# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This porject consists of: 
1) a tidy data set as described below
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

The data for the project can be found here:

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following: 

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
